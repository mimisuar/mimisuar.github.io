							<p>I've been coding since middle school, focusing on game development. I focus on Unity, but have experience with Godot as well. 
							Because I mostly work with Unity, I am proficient with C#/.NET. Outside of Unity and C#, I use C++ and Python for personal projects. 
						I've built games, simple web apps, desktop automation apps, and more.</p>
					<p>
					I graduated from MIT in 2022 with a degree in Comparative Media Studies, focusing on game design and development. I also studied math for two years, with particular focus on abstract and linear algebra.
					During my time there, I frequently worked for the <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/">MIT Game Lab</a>, working on VR/AR games in Unity. Since then, I've been doing freelance development work with <a href="https://www.createneptune.com/">Create Neptune</a>.</p>

						<h2>Skills</h2>
						<p><strong>Unity</strong> - I've worked on a variety of game projects, including desktop games, mobile games, VR games for Occulus Rift, and more. I also have some experience incorperating technology like MediaPipe into Unity. </p>
						<br/>
						<p><strong>C++</strong> - I've been using C++ for personal projects for several years, focusing on Modern C++ (C++17 and C++20). I mostly use it for 2D game development, but have experiemented with low-level graphics rendering with OpenGL.</p>
						<br/>
						<p><strong>Python</strong> - I've used Python mostly for small programs, ranging from simple data analysis, to task automation, to Flask web apps.</p>
						<br/>
						<p><strong>Git</strong> - I use Git on a daily basis, for work and for personal projects. I've used Git and GitHub collaboratively for 5 years. </p>
						<br/>
						<p><strong>Audio/Sound Design</strong> - I make music as a hobby, and I like to compose original music for games I work on. My work ranges from synthwave/EDM to industrial/noise.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Horatama</a></h3>
								<p>Your child asks you to take care of their Horatama virtual pets for the night. It seems innocent at first, but you quickly find out failure has deadly consequences...</p>
								<p><i>Horatama</i> is a class project I work on with a few other students over the course of a semester. As part of the class, we took the game from initial design to prototype, 
									putting it through several rounds of playtesting to get it to a playable state. Initially, my role on the team was composing music and making sound effects. I wrote all the code for how the music and sound works in game, including adding relevent UI elements.
									As the semester ended, I took more and more coding work, helping code some of the minigame and pet behaviors. We ended up working on the game after the class ended, releasing it through Steam. 
									I added the Steam achivement code to the project, and helped with marketing by reaching out to various YouTubers and indie game publications. 

									Check out videos of the game on YouTube, or check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517510/Horatama/">Steam store page</a>!

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/mimisuar/SES">SES (Sheep Entertainment System)</a></h3>
								<p>This is a small project I started working on back in a highschool. I was interesting in trying to write a really barebones NES emulator, but found it too challenging for me at the time so I started working on a fantasy console.
									I designed a small CPU with memory specifications and CPU flags. I needed someway to actually code the thing, so I wrote a little assembly-inspired language, and a compiler I wrote in Lua.
									The language, SASM (SES Assembly), had support for procedures, macros, inline memory initialization (.db), and a simple "#include" function. 
									<p>The actually project was written in C++ using SFML for windowing and rendering. I was able to implement all of the opcodes from the "CPU", and I added basic input support, so you can use the keyboard as a controller. 
										I also designed a sandboxed filesystem for the console, allowing programs to store and recall data. The last thing I was able to implement in the project befor graduating high school was a graphics system, allowing programs to render simple sprites to the screen.
									</p>

									<p>Currently, the project is in a state of limbo, but I tinker with it from time to time. My current objectives are to fix the graphics system, and to implement a trivial audio synthesis module.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/mimisuar/Legendary-Bard">Legendary Bard</a></h3>
								<p>During my junior year of high school, I took part in the Maine App Challenge. Over the course of several months, I designed and built a game for teaching 
									relative pitch (being able to recognize intervals instead of the pitches themselves). As a musician, I've found that the intervals between notes tends to be more significant than the notes themselves. 
									In the game, the monsters will play a series of tones (the monsters are associated with an organ sound) which the player responds to using a piano. If the player gets it right, they get to attack the monster. 
								</p>
								<p>The project was built using Java and LibGDX, a fairly low-level graphics/audio/input API, using Android Studio. The game earned me a spot as a finalist in the competition.</p>
								<p>Because I made this while I was still in high school, I made some fairly poor design decisions (both code structure and game design), but I'm still proud of what I was able to accomplish by myself. </p>
								Here is the title music I composed for the game: <br><audio controls>
